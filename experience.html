            Before coming into college, I had no coding experience or deep understanding about any programming language. 
            It took some time to understand the basics of programming and how it is implemented.
            <br>
            After classes and tutorials and YouTube videos, I could say I am to an extent proficient in JAVA and C++, although I prefer JAVA.
            <br>
            I am currently learning Python and SQL. In addition, I am also learning C, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
