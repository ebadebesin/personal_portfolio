        <h1>Experiences</h1>

        <h2>Professional Development and Technical Proficiency</h2>
        
        <p>
            My foray into programming began without prior experience; it was an exhilarating challenge that involved mastering the 
            fundamentals through coursework, online tutorials, and countless hours of practice. My dedication has cultivated proficiency 
            in Java and C++, with a preference for the former due to its widespread application and robust community support. 
            Beyond these languages, my academic and personal pursuits have expanded my skill set to include Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL, enhancing 
            my capability in Web development, backend development, and data analysis. I am concurrently honing my skills in C, Swift, Go, R and lots more
            aiming to develop a versatile expertise in software development.

        <ul>
            June 2022 – August 2022

            <br>
            My internship at Intel Corporation was a deep dive into the world of cybersecurity and system vulnerabilities. I was involved in 
            fuzz testing using C++, identifying and mitigating code vulnerabilities which significantly reduced the risk of security breaches. 
            I contributed to creating technical documentation for security protocols, enhancing team-wide understanding and engagement in security 
            best practices. Through the use of assembly-level debugging tools, I analyzed binary executables, revealing insights that fortified 
            the integrity of our software.
